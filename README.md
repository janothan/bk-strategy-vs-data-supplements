The directories in `raw_results_data` have been generated with [MELT](https://github.com/dwslab/melt/). If you have any questions on how to interpret the `performance` result files, have a look at the [user guide for the default evaluation](https://dwslab.github.io/melt/matcher-evaluation/evaluators#evaluatorcsv). The `performance` directory also contains *all* alignments used in this paper. 

If you have any questions on how to interpret the `significance` result files, have a look at the [user guide for the significance evaluation](https://dwslab.github.io/melt/matcher-evaluation/evaluators#evaluatormcnemarsignificance).

A high resolution version of Figure 2 is provided in directory `significance_matrix`.
